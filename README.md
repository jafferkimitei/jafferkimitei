## Who I Am

I’m a full-stack engineer, frontend specialist, and AI integrator focused on building **intelligent, scalable, and human-centered web experiences**.

I don’t ship features —  
I architect **systems that think, adapt, and perform under real-world constraints**.

I build under the alias **THE GURU** —  
a working identity grounded in **systems thinking, execution clarity, and long-term leverage**.

---

## What I Build

**Frontend Systems**  
Component-driven architectures, motion orchestration, accessibility-first UI engineering.

**Backend Systems**  
APIs, auth, data modeling, performance optimization, scalable service design.

**AI Integration**  
LLMs embedded into products for insight generation, automation, and decision support.

**Design Systems**  
UX strategy, interaction design, visual language, and brand coherence.

## Selected Stack

  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nextjs,ts,tailwind,nodejs,postgres,redis,git,figma" />
</p>

**Core Tools**
- Next.js · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS
- Node.js · PostgreSQL · Redis
- Motion / GSAP
- OpenAI APIs · LLM tooling
- Figma · Adobe Suite

I keep the stack tight by design.  
Tools are chosen to **compound**, not decorate.

## Current Focus

- AI-native products where intelligence is infrastructure, not an add-on  
- Real-time systems, dashboards, and decision interfaces  
- Performance as UX — latency, trust, and perceived quality  
- Human-AI collaboration workflows (AskPortfolio, Eyzen)
